# Hack Club Sticker Database

This is the unofficial unified Hack Club sticker database! The code for this site is not open source yet (as it's a vibe coded mess I'm not comfortable with sharing yet), but you can contribute to the DB by forking this repo, adding your sticker to the /stickers directory (make sure to properly name it!), and if you know either, also give the artist and event in the pull request! I'll work on actually making this properly tomorrow!
