# Hack Club Sticker Database

This is the unofficial unified Hack Club sticker database! The code for this site is not open source yet (as it's a vibe coded mess I'm not comfortable with sharing yet), but you can contribute to the DB still if you have the source file! This means PNG or SVG, and _no scans_. Here's how to contribute:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Name your file(s) appropriately.
3. Upload it to the /stickers directory.
4. Make a pull request! If you know the event and/or the artist of the sticker, mention it in the pull request!
5. Wait for it to be merged!
