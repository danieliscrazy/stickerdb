# Hack Club Sticker Database
> https://stickers.dld.hackclub.app

This is the unofficial unified Hack Club sticker database! If you have high quality digital/source files of stickers from official Hack Club programs or events, please contribute! This means PNG or SVG, and _no pictures or scans_. Here's how to contribute:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Name your file(s) appropriately.
3. Upload to the /static/stickers directory.
4. If you know them, edit artists.json and.or programs.json and add the sticker(s) to it.
4. Make a pull request!

The code in the repo is the code for stickers.dld.hackclub.app. It also has an API. You can use https://stickers.dld.hackclub.app/api/all to get a listing of all stickers, and you can sort by program or artist by using those arguments, e.g. https://stickers.dld.hackclub.app/api/all?artist=@bunnyguy&program=High%20Seas. 

> The code files (but not the stickers!) in this repository are AI generated.
